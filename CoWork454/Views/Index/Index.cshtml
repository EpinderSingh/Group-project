        <h3>Enjoy the Best of Both Worlds!</h3>
        <p>
            Life and work balance are more important than ever. Many of us have discovered that we need a better way of working.
        </p>
        <p>
            We enjoyed avoiding the traffic and not commuting to the City.
        </p>
        <p>
            We loved the extra time at home, but we really missed the contact with others.
        </p>
        <p>
            We found Zoom meetings were okay, but they did not give us that nurturing warmth we got from meeting in person.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are social beings and work best in the company of other friendly people.
        </p>
        <p>
            What we realised, is we need a new way to work - An environment that supports our productivity and quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need a personal work solution, with easy access to home, the beach and the City.
